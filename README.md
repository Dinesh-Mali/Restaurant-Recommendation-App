# Restaurant-Recommendation-App
We have build a restaurant recommendation system using KMeans Clustering.

# Introduction
Recommender system has the ability to predict whether a particular user would prefer an item or not based on the user's profile.
Recommender systems are beneficial to both service providers and users.

In this project we are building a recommendation system/model that will recommend us restaurants in a particular destination taking in your latitute
and longitude geographic location.

# Project Flow

1) We will be taking datasetand train our model according to the review it has and its locations. we will be using KMeans clustering.

2) we will also see how to potray geographical data into our colab file using plotly library.

3) Finally we build the recommendation system that will recommends a restaurant based on the location data as input by the user.
